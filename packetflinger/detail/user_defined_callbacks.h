// User-defined callbacks:
//
//  - There are no file descriptors involved. We just map from events to
//    callbacks (and back for unregistering, etc.)
//  - The lookup occurs via the event mask.
//  - Lookup happens both within the scheduler (system events) and on the
//    caller side (via fire_events()), so should be fast. Since the event
//    mask is a bitset, it's likely that an ordered key set will yield the
//    fastest lookup.
//  - The value set is non-unique: the same event mask can be associated with
//    multiple callbacks.
//    With traditional containers (e.g. map<events, list<callback>>) that
//    would provide for tricky merging problems when the event mask for one
//    of the callbacks is modified, but the rest remains unaffected.
//  - The key needs to be mutable (see above).
