/**
 * The connector class provides a socket-like API for handling I/O.
 *
 * We're deliberately not re-using the socket term, as it is associated with
 * network I/O specifically, whereas packeteer can handle other types of I/O.
 * However, the usage is fairly similar to how you'd use sockets.
 *
 * The connector class is deliberately constructed with minimal data members,
 * enabling us to provide a stable API/ABI even if implementations for
 * individual protocols change wildly.
 *
 * Internally, a registry of connector implementations is held. You can
 * extend connector's behaviour by adding implementations to the registry
 * via connector's static registry functions.

  /**
   * Constructor. Specify the address the connector represents, as a URI
   * string. Possible schemes are:
   *
   *  - tcp4: IPv4 TCP connection
   *  - tcp6: IPv6 TCP connection
   *  - tcp: IPv4 and/or IPv6 TCP connection, depending on availability
   *  - udp4: IPv4 UDP connection
   *  - udp6: IPv6 UDP connection
   *  - udp: IPv4 or IPv6 UDP connection, depending on availability
   *  - anon: unidirectionaly anonymous pipe. Mostly usable for IPC between
   *      processes that inherit the underlying system handles.
   *  - local: UNIX domain sockets (POSIX; Win32 from Windows 10)
   *  - pipe: Windows named pipe. Bidirectional, and largely behave as
   *      UNIX domain sockets.
   *  - fifo: POSIX named pipe. Bidirectional and multi client in theory;
   *      in practice, being FIFOs they work to broadcast anything written
   *      to all readers, including the sender.
   *
   * Of these, the first six expect the address string to have the format:
   *    scheme://address[:port]
   *
   * All connectors are blocking by default. To switch them to non-blocking
   * mode, set the "blocking" query parameter to "no", "false" or "0". Note
   * that when you use connectors with the scheduler, they get turned non-
   * blocking automatically.
   *
   * Some connectors can be used with datagram or stream behaviour. The default
   * is usually the most optimal setting. If you want to specify the behaviour
   * explicitly, provide the "behaviour" parameter with either the "datagram"
   * or "stream" value.
   *
   * The anonymous pipe expects the scheme to be followed by nothing at all.
   *    anon://[optional parameters]
   *
   * The last few expect the following format:
   *    scheme://path[optional parameters]
   *
   * The scheme part is not case sensitive. The address for IPv6 is not case
   * sensitive. Path names are case sensitive on operating systems where path
   * names generally are.
   *
   * Path names should follow URL standards with forard slashes delimiting
   * path segments. Unescaped forward slashes will be translated to
   * backslashes on Windows as necessary.
   *
   * The constructor will throw if an address could not be parsed. Note that
   * paths will not be parsed immediately, but only when the connection
   * specified by the connector is to be established.
   *
   * The default constructed connector does not have any connection semantics,
   * but is assignable and very lightweight - and can therefore be used in
   * place of a connector pointer.
