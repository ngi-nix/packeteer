/**
 * Registers a connector type that just wraps an already opened POSIX
 * file descriptor. Use "filedesc:///123" or "fd:///123" to wrap file
 * descriptor 123.
 *
 * Special handling is added for file descriptors named "stdin",
 * "stdout" and "stderr" respectively; these are mapped to STDIN_FILENO,
 * STDOUT_FILENO and STDERR_FILENO respectively.
 *
 * Resulting connectors do not support listen() and connect() methods,
 * as the application must take care of opening them. Similarly,
 * accept() just returns the same connector.
 *
 * Also note that only CO_STREAM style connectors are supported.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   1. auto x = open(path, flags);
 *      auto conn = connector{api, "fd:///" + to_string(x)};
 *   2. auto conn = connector{api, "filedesc:///stderr"};
