/*****************************************************************************
 * The scheduler class sits at the core of the packeteer implementation.
 *
 * It's a cross between an efficient I/O poller and a (statically sized)
 * thread pool implementation. Functions can be scheduled to run on one of the
 * worker threads at a specified time, or when a connector becomes ready for I/O.
 *
 * As with other thread pool implementations, you must take care to avoid
 * performing blocking or long-running tasks in callbacks or risk reducing the
 * efficiency of the scheduler as a whole.
 *
 * For I/O events, callbacks will be invoked once per connector for which any I/O
 * event occurred, e.g. once for (PEV_IO_READ | PEV_IO_WRITE). For other events,
 * callbacks will be invoked once per event that occurred.
