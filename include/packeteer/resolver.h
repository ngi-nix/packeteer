 * The resolver class offers an interface for resolving URLs. In principle,
 * this is a little broader in scope than resolving solely host names to IP
 * addresses, though in practice, that is going to be the most used case.
 *
 * You can register resolving functions for URL schemes.
 *
 * A single input URL can resolve to multiple output URLs; for example,
 * resolving a host name can result in multiple IPv4 *and* IPv6 addresses.
 *
 * Note that the resolution functions may cache resolution results.
