/**
 * Parses a CIDR-notation network specification into a socketaddr_storage
 * sized buffer (setting the port part to 0), and a bitmask length.
 *
 * Returns the bitmask length. The sockaddr_storage is filled in by this
 * function.
 *
 * Returns -1 if the network specification could not be parsed.
 *
 * If the no_mask flag is set, this function expects *no* netmask part to
 * the string, and can be used to parse IPv4 and IPv6 host addresses. On
 * success, it will return 0.
 *
 * However, the function will then return an error (-1) if the mask is
 * present after all.
 *
 * Also returns the protocol type in the proto value.
 *
 * The CIDR specification is extended in that we also parse ports, if specified.
 * Note that any argument to the port parameter will override the port
 * specification found in the cidr string.
 *
 * For IPv4 and IPv6, the port is specified after the address part, separated by
 * a colon. For IPv6, the address part additionally needs to be enclosed in
 * square brackets. Note that if a port is specified, a netmask cannot be and
 * vice versa.
