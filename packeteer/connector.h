   * Constructor. Specify the address the connector represents, as a URI
   * string. Possible schemes are:
   *
   *  - tcp4: IPv4 TCP connection
   *  - tcp6: IPv6 TCP connection
   *  - tcp: IPv4 and/or IPv6 TCP connection, depending on availability
   *  - udp4: IPv4 UDP connection
   *  - udp6: IPv6 UDP connection
   *  - udp: IPv4 or IPv6 UDP connection, depending on availability
   *  - anon: anonymous pipe, similar to the pipe class. Mostly usable for
   *      IPC between processes that inherit the file descriptors. Anonymous
   *      pipes are unidirectional.
   *  - file: file system operations (limited usage)
   *  - local: UNIX domain sockets (POSIX)
   *  - pipe: UNIX named pipe or Windows named pipe
   *
   * Of these, the first six expect the address string to have the format:
   *    scheme://address[:port]
   *
   * The anonymous pipe expects the scheme to be followed by nothing at all,
   * or one of the keywords "blocking" or "nonblocking", to specify whether
   * a blocking or non-blocking pipe is expected. If the keyword is left out,
   * a non-blocking pipe is created.
   *    anon://[blocking|nonblocking]
   *
   * The last few expect the following format:
   *    scheme://path
   *
   * The scheme part is not case sensitive. The address for IPv6 is not case
   * sensitive. Path names are case sensitive on operating systems where path
   * names generally are.
   *
   * The constructor will throw if an address could not be parsed. Note that
   * paths will not be parsed immediately, but only when the connection
   * specified by the connector is to be established.
