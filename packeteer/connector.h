 * The connector class provides a socket-like API for handling I/O.

 * However, the usage is fairly similar to how you'd use sockets.

   * Constructor. Specify the address the connector represents, as a URI
   * string. Possible schemes are:
   *
   *  - tcp4: IPv4 TCP connection
   *  - tcp6: IPv6 TCP connection
   *  - tcp: IPv4 and/or IPv6 TCP connection, depending on availability
   *  - udp4: IPv4 UDP connection
   *  - udp6: IPv6 UDP connection
   *  - udp: IPv4 or IPv6 UDP connection, depending on availability
   *  - file: file system operations (limited usage)
   *  - ipc: UNIX domain sockets/inter-process communication socket;
   *      or named pipe on Windows.
   *  - pipe: UNIX named pipe (unidirectional; not available on Windows)
   *
   * Of these, the first six expect the address string to have the format:
   *    scheme://address[:port]
   *
   * The last three expect the following format:
   *    scheme://path
   *
   * The scheme part is not case sensitive. The address for IPv6 is not case
   * sensitive. Path names are case sensitive on operating systems where path
   * names generally are.
   *
   * The constructor will throw if an address could not be parsed. Note that
   * paths will not be parsed immediately, but only when the connection
   * specified by the connector is to be established.
