/*****************************************************************************
 * A simple concurrent queue implementation; lifted with small changes from
 * Herb Sutter's "Writing a Generalized Concurrent Queue"
 * http://drdobbs.com/high-performance-computing/211601363
 *
 * The queue implementation uses a producer spinlock and a consumer spinlock,
 * on the assumption that we'll have multiple producers and consumers.
 * Technically, we only have 1:N and N:1 situations, i.e. one producer and
 * multiple consumers or vice versa. In the interest of simplicity, we'll just
 * stick with the N:M implementation Sutter provides.
 *
 * The main change (other than some symbol name changes) is the addition of
 * the size() and empty() functions, which use the consumer lock and can
 * therefore contend with the consumers.
 *
 * Note that while this implementation uses STL-ish symbol names, it makes no
 * attempt at providing a full STL-like container.
