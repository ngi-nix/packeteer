/**
 * Overlapped I/O requires context for each I/O operation until it has
 * completed.
 *
 * The main piece is an OVERLAPPED structure. Read and write operations
 * need to lock the buffer they're using, and cannot re-use them for anything
 * else until the operation completed. Lastly, for waiting on overlapped
 * events, we need a handle per overlapped context.
 *
 * This is different semantics from POSIX read()/write():
 * - POSIX write() just tries to write the same buffer until it succeeds.
 *   To simulate this, we need to treat writes of the same buffer to the
 *   same handle as checks on whether the I/O operation has completed.
 *   The difference is once scheduled, the operation should eventually
 *   succeed, whereas POSIX waits for the user to try again. The best
 *   we can do is try and cancel pending writes should the user decide to
 *   write something else on the same handle.
 * - POSIX read() effectively copies from OS buffers to userspace buffers
 *   when an I/O operation completes. To simulate that, we need to allocate
 *   and pass a operation-specific buffer to ReadFile(), then copy it over
 *   on success.
 *
 * In either case, it seems we have to copy buffers in order to simulate
 * POSIX style effectively, which we need to do for a consistent API.
 *
 * This file contains functionality for handling this in a way that is not
 * tied to any specific connector.

   *
   * Because it's the only efficient approach with multiple I/O contexts,
   * the function will also search the existing contexts for similar
   * requests.
   *
   * Depending on the I/O type, the callback may be invoked multiple times
   * with different I/O actions for the caller to perform. The ideal situation
   * is for the callback to be invoked exactly once with an I/O action matching
   * the I/O type - that's when the context is set up for scheduling the
   * operation.
   *
   * Other actions may include checking on another context whether it's
   * completed.
   *
   * Any error the callback returns immediately leads to
   * schedule_overlapped() to abort and return the same error. In this way,
   * the caller has full control over when to abort actions.
   *
   * Errors schedule_overlapped() may return include:
   * - ERR_SUCCESS:
   *   A pending operation *completed*, and that's the only thing to be done.
   *   This may happen e.g. when attempting to schedule the same CONNECT or WRITE
   *   as done at some previous point.
   * - ERR_ASYNC:
   *   This should be the normal case, i.e. the overlapped I/O operation was
   *   scheduled, but has not yet completed.
   * - ERR_INVALID_VALUE:
   *   - for CONNECT, when other operations for the same handle are still
   *     pending.
   *   - for WRITE, when the source buffer or length are not provided.
   * - ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY:
   *   Could not allocate a context for this operation.
   * - ERR_REPEAT_ACTION:
   *   - for WRITE, when the same write has already been scheduled. This is
   *     largely identical to handle as ERR_ASYNC.
   * - ERR_ABORTED and others:
   *   A callback has determined that the schedule_overlapped() function
   *   should error out prematurely.
