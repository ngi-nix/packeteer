/**
 * io_thread runs an I/O subsystem in a background thread, yielding
 * event_data whenever the I/O loop registers any.
 *
 * In order to do its job, it needs to have:
 * a) An I/O subsystem instance to use for the I/O loop.
 * b) A connector on which the I/O loop can be interrupted for graceful
 *    shutdown.
 * c) A queue in which to place I/O event data.
 * d) A connector on which it can notify that I/O event data is in the queue.
 *
 * Note: the queue is a little weird because we want to avoid copying
 *       event_data unnecessarily. For performance reasons, it is a vector
 *       in the io interface. In the thread model, we would have to lock a
 *       vector to append to it, introducing an unwanted bottleneck. So as
 *       a compromise, the queue is a queue of vectors of event_data.
