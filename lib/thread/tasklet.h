/**
 * Tasklet class
 *
 * The tasklet class is a simple extension to the thread class even more focused
 * on reusability. In particular, it assumes that your typical threaded app will
 * run a number of threads for a long time, which wait on some condition varaible,
 * wake up, and then go to sleep again.
 *
 * That is, it simplifies this kind of thread function:
 *
 * scoped_lock lock(my_mutex);
 * while (running) {
 *   my_condition.timed_wait(lock, some_time);
 *   if (!running) {
 *     return;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Do stuff, e.g. pick up some work from a queue
 * }
 *
 * That means the tasklet encapsulates a flag that tells it whether it should
 * still be running, a condition variable, and a mutex.
 *
 * Quite often - e.g. when having multiple worker threads and a work queue -
 * multiple threads will want to share the same condition variable and mutex,
 * and that is also possible with the tasklet class.
 *
 * Note that in order for all of this to work, your thread function needs to
 * accept a tasklet reference. The actual implementation of such a tasklet
 * function would look like this:
 *
 * void my_func(tasklet & t) {
 *   while (tasklet.sleep(some_time)) {
 *     // do something
 *   }
 * }

  /**
   * Create a tasklet either with or without a condition. If created with
   * a condition, it shares the given condition, possibly with other tasklet
   * instances. Note that if you provide a shared condition, you will also
   * need to provide a shared recursive_mutex for waiting.
   *
   * Note that stop() and wakeup() will usually call notify_one() on an owned
   * condition object, such that the semantics of waking a tasklet out of
   * sleep() are met. For a shared condition object, that doesn't work quite
   * the same way; for that reason, the condition's notify_all() will be
   * called.
   *
   * If you don't want that, use the condition object you're passing directly.
